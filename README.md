# Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

After completing my initial tutorial in PHP, I sought out mini-projects to apply what I learned. [This site](https://www.zend.com/blog/php-beginner-projects) mentioned Tic-Tac-Toe, and I was inspired to try it out!

Here, I had the opportunity to practice:
* Sessions
* Arrays
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

Additional styling and error handling coming soon!
